# HPC-simulator-project
This is a project done by me as part of BTech Project(BTP) under the supervision of Prof. Soumyajit Dey, CSE Department, IIT Kharagpur.
The main objective of the project is to design a High Performance Computing Simulator that intelligently schedules data parallel workloads 
on heterogenous computing systems to optimize the makespan of the entire application. The data parallel workloads here refer kernels in an
OpenCL program(a well known language for parallel programming). Machine learning models are used to predict the kernel to device mapping to make
the computation optimal.
